        "description": "This project significantly transformed the data ingestion process for 15 databases in the insurance industry. Initially, the setup involved 6 DMS instances and several Glue PySpark jobs, incurring substantial costs of $7.8k and $5k monthly, respectively, and a processing time exceeding 4 hours.\n\nThe overhaul introduced a streamlined approach with just one Attunity instance and a single Redshift instance. This shift brought the monthly costs down to $2.5k for Attunity and $2k for Redshift. Impressively, this change represented a cost reduction of approximately 68%, alongside a dramatic decrease in processing time to less than an hour. This strategic move not only slashed expenses but also significantly accelerated the data processing efficiency, marking a major advancement in the company's operational capabilities."
